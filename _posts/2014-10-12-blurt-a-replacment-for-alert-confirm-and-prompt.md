*Blurt* is a replacement for the default ```alert(), confirm() and prompt()``` functions. Inspired by [sweetAlert](https://github.com/t4t5/sweetalert/), it is implemented using custom _css_ and _js_ .

Download the minified *blurt* css and js files [here](http://goo.gl/nWQoCQ). Link the files in your webpage and get going.

Read the complete usage with examples on [Blurt project website](http://bitwiser.in/blurt/).
